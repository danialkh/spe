# Distributed - Fleet Operational Center

A distributed multi-node server environment built to orchestrate and monitor real-time network states. This system incorporates a Dockerized Node.js backend alongside a highly optimized, visual dashboard frontend featuring real-time telemetry elements like interactive SVG gauge animations, dynamic temperature rows, and granular signal-bar urgency indicators.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Distributed Architecture:** Engineered for scalable, multi-node communication.
* **Real-Time Fleet UI:** Single-page tracking panel (`fleet_operational_center.html`) to visualize status across endpoints.
* **Dynamic Telemetry:** Custom CSS-animated SVG gauges (`.gauge-wrap`, `.gauge-arc`) displaying cool, warm, and critical states.
* **Urgency Indicators:** Custom responsive signal bars (`.signal`, `.signal.bars`) indicating immediate network priority.
* **Production Ready:** Pre-configured Docker environment for instant containerized deployment.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* Ensure you have [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://google.com) installed.

### 1. Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com
cd DistributedCodenamesGame
```

### 2. Launch with Docker Compose
Spin up the entire node network and backend environment instantly:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Access the Dashboards
Once container initialization completes, open your web browser to view your live fleet tracking metrics:
* **Primary Console:** `http://localhost:3000` *(or your configured backend port)*
* **Fleet Control:** `http://localhost:3000/frontend/fleet_operational_center.html`

## 🎛️ UI & Styling Customization

The dashboard relies on lightweight CSS variables (`var(--accent)`, `var(--warn)`, `var(--crit)`) mapped onto native elements for low overhead:
* **Typography:** Built using the ultra-readable `IBM Plex Mono` monospace font for structural telemetry readability.
* **Gauges:** SVG strokes use transitions (`transition: stroke .4s ease`) to smoothly glide between network performance spikes without triggering page-wide repaints.
